# Mastering Data Mining with SEMMA: Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates the application of the SEMMA methodology (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) in a practical machine learning workflow using Python. The project involves building a Random Forest classification model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal dimensions.

The entire process follows the SEMMA framework:

1. Sample: We use the Iris dataset, a popular dataset for classification tasks.
2. Explore: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
3. Modify: Data is cleaned, split into training and testing sets, and features are scaled for optimal model performance.
4. Model: A Random Forest classifier is trained on the data.
5. Assess: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

I have written medium article on this.
