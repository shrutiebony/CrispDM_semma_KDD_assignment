# Predicting Customer Churn: Applying the KDD Process Using Python

The KDD process is a powerful approach for extracting valuable insights from large datasets. In this article, we’ll walk through a step-by-step implementation of KDD, applied to customer churn prediction using Python. We’ll explore each phase of the process, from data selection to knowledge representation, using the Titanic dataset as an example. By the end, you’ll understand how to implement the KDD methodology in real-world machine learning projects.

What is the KDD Process?

The KDD process consists of six essential stages that guide the analysis from raw data to actionable insights. These stages are:

1. Data Selection: Identifying relevant data.

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data.

3. Data Transformation: Structuring data for analysis.

4. Data Mining: Applying algorithms to extract patterns.

5. Pattern Evaluation: Interpreting the results.

6. Knowledge Representation: Presenting the findings.

I have written medium article on this.
