# CRISP - DM

CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, a widely used methodology for data mining and machine learning projects. It provides a structured approach to planning and executing a data science project. The process consists of six major phases, which are iterative and adaptable to various project types. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each phase:

1. Business Understanding:
   Focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
   Key tasks: Define the business objectives, assess the situation, define success criteria, and create a project plan.

2. Data Understanding:
   Involves gathering data and familiarizing with it.
   Key tasks: Collect initial data, describe the data, explore the data, and verify its quality.

3. Data Preparation:
   Covers all activities needed to construct the final dataset for modeling.
   Key tasks: Clean the data, transform variables, handle missing values, and prepare datasets for analysis.

4. Modeling:
   Focuses on selecting and applying various machine learning models to the prepared data.
   Key tasks: Select modeling techniques, train models, tune parameters, and evaluate performance.

5. Evaluation:
   After modeling, assess the models in the context of the business objectives.
   Key tasks: Review models, ensure they meet business goals, and decide on the next steps.

6. Deployment:
   Involves making the results available in a practical and useful way.
   Key tasks: Create a deployment plan, generate reports, implement model monitoring, and ensure successful integration into the business.
   
CRISP-DM is an iterative process, meaning insights or issues found during one phase may lead to revisiting earlier phases.

I have written medium article on this.
